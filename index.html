            <span class="c2">Black</span> is a very simple color, but it is very special. 
            We see <span class="c3">black</span> in many things around us. 
            For example, the night sky looks <span class="c4">black</span>. 
            When we look at the <span class="c5">black</span> sky, we feel calm and peaceful.

            In school programs or parties, many people choose <span class="c9">black</span> because it looks neat and beautiful.

            <span class="c14">Black</span> matches with every color. 
            If we mix <span class="c15">black</span> with red, it looks bold. 
            If we mix <span class="c16">black</span> with yellow, it looks bright. 
            That is why <span class="c17">black</span> is a very useful color.

            Sometimes people think <span class="c18">black</span> means sadness, but <span class="c19">black</span> also means strength and confidence. 
            When we close our eyes, we see <span class="c20">black</span>, and it gives rest to our mind.

            <br><br>

            In my opinion, <span class="c21">black</span> is not just a color. 
            It is a color of power, style, and simplicity.
